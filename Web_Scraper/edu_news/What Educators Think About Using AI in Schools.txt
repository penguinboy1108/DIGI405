For years, educators have already been using some products powered byartificial intelligenceto teach or to help with logistics, such as planning bus routes.
But in recent months, the rise ofChatGPT—an AI-powered tool that can write anything with just a simple prompt—has ignited debates about the benefits and drawbacks of the use of artificial intelligence in education.
Some educators are worried about how students might use AI-driven technologies like ChatGPT tocheat on school assignments, and others are embracing these products tosave them time in responding to emails and creating rubrics.

Nearly half of educators who responded to a recent EdWeek Research Center survey said AI would have a negative or very negative impact on teaching and learning in the next five years. Twenty-seven percent said AI’s impact would be positive or very positive.

In the open-ended response section of the survey—which was conducted between March 29 and April 11 and had responses from 863 teachers, principals, and district leaders—two dozen educators told us how they felt about AI.
From concerns about its harms to ideas on how it will change the education system, here’s what they said.
