Many educators who have used generativeartificial intelligencetools in their work have called the emerging technology a “game changer.”
Some say it’s been especially helpful in reducing the time it takes to do planning oradministrative work, such as creating schedules, crafting lesson plans, and writing letters of recommendation for students. Teachers saythey work an average of 57 hours a week, but less than half of that time is spent teaching.
“I think the use of AI has streamlined many aspects of teaching and has saved much prep time for teachers,” said a high school fine arts teacher in California in an open-ended response to an EdWeek Research Center survey conducted in March and April.

But amid all the encouragement to try the technology, there are plenty of educators who haven’t tried AI tools anddon’t plan to start. These educators are more skeptical of the technology and don’t believe it should be used in K-12.
